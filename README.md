# Turquoise

Turquoise is a simple GUI for managing your Apache localhost sites. I've been trying to use proper webservers more often while I create websites (so I can access my stuff via http instead of file in browsers). Apache is a simple solution that I don't know too much about, but this GUI makes it quicker to use.

I wanted to use RubyTK to build this app bu decided to use Electron for quicker development (I'm already much more familiar with Electron).
